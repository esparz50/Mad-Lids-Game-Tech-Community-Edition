# Mad-Lids-Game-Tech-Community-Edition
Since I am learning more on Python from freeCodeCamp's YouTube video on Python Tutorial, I made this program.
I do watch a lot of tech YouTube videos and supportive towards them. 
So here are the rules: Enter the color of your PC and accessories like mouse and keyboard, gaming headsets, etc. 
Enter a plural noun for overclocking like processors, GPU (Nvidia or AMD), ram, monitor, etc. 
Last input your favorite tech YouTuber/celebrity and it will print out Stan with your favorite YouTuber/celebrity. 
The output will be printed with your inputs.
Thank you and I hope you enjoy this program.
